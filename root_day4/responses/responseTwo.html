      <h2>The TCCN Internet - September 25 2020</h2>
      <p>“The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought The US Would Mess It Up” is an article that, despite it’s long title, is well worth a read as it details the initiative for an independent, Canadian version of the internet that never came to be.  This is framed around a discussion of the repealing of Net Neutrality laws in the United States, an event which displayed a terrifying apathy on the part of the US government to protect the equity and freedom of access to the internet. Reading through the article, it becomes apparent that the rationale which brought upon the discussion of a Canadian internet was founded on correct suspicions, as the US has a way of letting capitalistic systems take over every industry. What I find most intriguing is not necessarily the fact that we had at one point wanted our own internet, but rather the fact that such a concept is practically unheard of in the news or in any major publication. I find it particularly odd since the signs of the US’s internet being corrupt have been present for a long time, and suspicions surrounding companies like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been around for years, only having been brought to the public record through court proceedings. Above all else, this article has made me hopeful that Canada can find its own alternate systems to use when the US inevitably fails, seeing as lobbyists seem to always win in the end in matters of US law. Of course, there are concerns to be had over our government being in charge of an entire internet system, though so long as said system is made in a way that holds them to account, while also being partially operated by the public, I’d hope that we’d be able to avoid recreating the CCP’s style of “free” internet.</p>
