      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p> My name is Steve Berthiaume, though you've probably figured that out already. I'm a 19 year old first year in the Computation Arts program hosted at Concordia University.
          My key interest since childhood has been game design, though I find myself greatly interested by the arts and creative expression as a whole.
      </p>
      <p> I spend most of my spare time playing video games, spending an inordinate time thinking about the intricaties that make them possible. While my lifelong dream has been to work on games
        professionally, I've certainly not waited on thinking about what makes a good or interesting game, or attempting to make one myself.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to hosting the various assignments and readings I've worked on for the CART 211 course, this website has a Works section where you can view some of my creations. The Contact section
      is for social media, though I scarcely post.
      </p>
      <p> Thank you if you actually read all of this, I guess. This site exists first and foremost for CART 211 storage, so you had no obligation to read this.
