    <p>Given the fact I'd like to create a satire site parodying the Quebec government, I find the following sites to be useful examples for me:</p>

        Font and color choices taken from Quebec's official site.

    <p>NRA - Share the safety -</p>
    <p>Share the safety is interesting in that absolutely everything on the page is attributed to the NRA. Despite being a parody, there are essentially no signs that the sign is fake, leaving one to wonder if it's an actual page by the NRA. I like that effect and would like to try it, though I'd have an indication at least somewhere to avoid issues from impersonating the government.</p>

    <p>Looking at the work of other activists, the WWF has made numerous articles on oil companies, one of which (linked below) interests me as it pairs fixed images with fixed text, and also uses a simple appearing image, without taking awya from the seriousness of the topic.</p>

    <p>As for what I'm seeking to directly immitate, the site I took my style information from is linked below here. Most sites run by the government of Quebec utilize the same color scheme and font choices, so immitating one means immitating them all.</p>
