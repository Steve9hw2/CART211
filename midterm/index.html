    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>Starting in 2020, we've been faced with what may be the single most important challenge of our lives: COVID-19. While health professionals have made it very clear that we need to maintain social distancing as well as masks in order to keep eachother safe, the safest option of all has remained to simply abstain from being in public places.</p>

        Note the fact that places caring for the elderly are the highest in deaths, and that schools replicate many issues seen there.

    <p>We have proof for the dangers of being in enclosed spaces with few supervising officials; one only has to look at the nursing home crisis we've had, with countless elderly succumbing to COVID-19, as well as other complications as collateral from this unprecedented health crisis. Simply put, there aren't enough professionals there to keep watch, enforce rules, and keep safe themselves.</p>
    <p>Despite the dangers, the government of Quebec has chosen to send elementary and high school students back to school. Of course, this is also while the education system, as with many other sectors, is suffering from an extreme lack of staff. Beyond that, children are prone to inadvertedly spreading the disease, being that they may be unaware of the required rules, unaware of the severity of the consequences, or too lacking in developed empathy to understand why they should care.</p>
    <p>My point? Don't send them back to schools.</p>
