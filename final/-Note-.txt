Hi Santo.

Throughout the whole semester, I've felt myself greatly struggling to understand
what I've been doing, and CSS specifically has felt like an impassible roadblock 
to me. I considered reaching out a few times, but I was concerned that everyone
else in the class knew exactly what they were doing and that I didn't belong in 
the class if I couldn't follow, so I didn't really improve.

My final is pretty minimal, and I'm aware that it lacks javascript and transitions,
though I did try to get the latter working to no effect. I spent roughly a month
trying to get things to display vertically without overlapping or refusing to
change height, so my expectations were incredibly low. 

If you read this, thank you very much. I hope you'll be able to understand where
I'm coming from as a first timer with HTML and CSS with no clue about the structure
of either.
