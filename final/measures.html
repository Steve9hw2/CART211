        <h2>The Measures</h2>
        <p>The following measures are being implemented* at all of our schools in order to ensure the safety of all students and staff.</p>
        <p>  Social Distancing: all students will have to maintain a distance of at least that much. Staff will maintain a distance of eh, about this much.</p>
        <p>  Wearing Masks: a few students might be forced to wear a mask, while others likely take them off all the time and get away because of a lack of supervision, but we're saying they're wearing them so it's fine.</p>
        <p>  Washing Hands: students and staff will routinely wash their hands, though we make no promises on the subject of school sanitation since we're still struggling to get the air at an acceptable level of CO2</p>
        <p>  Restricted Contact: students will be kept in the same room all day to protect them from other classes, though we make no promises that they're not instead trapped in the same room as an infected person.</p>
        <p>  Infected Students: students who are infected will be told to stay at home maybe, regardless of the fact others have likely already been contaminated. Those who were in contact will still attend classes because they can't be allowed to miss out on the vital thirty seconds of attendance class.</p>
        <p>  Transparency: we maintain the right to continue publishing infection statistics at our discretion, since they make us look bad.</p>
        <h6>implementation may take up to 2050 if we get elected until then and circumstances remain the same</h6>
